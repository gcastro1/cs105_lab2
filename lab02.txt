1. 
After typing c to contiue past the breakpoint, we receive:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007ffff7e64676 in __GI_____strtol_l_internal (nptr=0x0, endptr=endptr@entry=0x0, base=base@entry=10, group=group@entry=0, 
    loc=0x7ffff7fb9420 <_nl_global_locale>) at ../stdlib/strtol_l.c:283
283     ../stdlib/strtol_l.c: No such file or directory.

2.
#3  0x0000000000401175 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe5d8) at problem1.c:18
18          printf("%d\n", loop_while(atoi(argv[1]), 16));

We are in problem1.c, at line 18.

3.
No we cannot see the argument passed into atoi (nptr).

4.
The value printed is:

(gdb) print argv[1]
$1 = 0x0

5.
After running the program with a value of 5. gbd prints:

-1835
[Inferior 1 (process 26885) exited normally]

6.
The value of argc is 2. The elements of the argv array are {"/mnt/home/gcastro/courses/cs105/lab2/problem1", "5"}.
The 0 element comes from the beginning address of the stack frame and the 1 element is left over value from when we ran problem 1 with the argv 5. 
argc comes from the number of the elements in argv chracter array.

7.
We get to atoi.c. line 26:

After we run "s" again, we get to problem1.c, line 6.

8.
We see line 1-10 in problem1.c. After hitting enter, we see line 11-20 in problem1.c.

9.
the return key repeat the last used command in gbd.

10.
Printing the values of result, a, and b; gives result = 10, a = 5, b = 16.

11.
After running problem1 with an arugement of 10, we end up at line 8. However, loop_while starts at line 4.

12.
The program does not stop and exits normally with a return value of -1580.

13.
The address of the instruction callq that calls atoi is 0x000000000040106f.
The address of the instruction callq that calls printf is x0000000000401093.

14.
There is no call to loop_while, because between the two callq's the compiler uses optimization to 
remove the function call to loop_while.

15.
print/x 42 returns 0x2a, and p 0x2f returns 47.

16.
The second lea command contains a small constant 0x10 = 256 in line 8.
